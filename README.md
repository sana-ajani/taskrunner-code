# Task Runner

There is an NPM Explorer built into VS Code, this extension is no longer maintained.

## What is this?

There are many tools that exist to automate parts of your project, including for installing dependencies, building, testing, linting, deploying. This extension adds an additional "Task Runner" view in your Explorer Pane to visualize and individually run the auto-detected tasks in your project. VS Code auto-detects the following task runners: Gulp, Grunt, Jake and npm.
